          <h2>1. Motivation</h2>

          <b>What is your dataset?</b>
          <p>
            Taxi trips dataset for New York was used for the analysis. The dataset is from
            the website <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml" target="_blank">NYC.gov</a>.
            The dataset contains taxi trips from yellow and green taxis but only the data
            for the yellow taxis were used. The dataset contains data of over 10 years, 2009-2017
            but it was decided to analyse all the data from 2017. The dataset contains
            among other things: pickup / drop-off locations and timestamps, payment types,
            number of passengers and trip distance.
          </p>

          <b>Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)?</b>
          <p>
            This dataset is really popular and has been used in many data analysis. The reason
            for that and a part of the reasons why we chose this dataset, is because it has a lot
            of data, both in terms of features and in terms of a number of rows. So with many features and
            detailed meta-data for the trips, it is possible to investigate and analyse many different aspects
            of the dataset. Therefore we picked this dataset even many people have used it before
            and we tried to find a new angle which others might not have covered before.
          </p>

          <b>What was your goal for the end user’s experience?</b>
          <p>
            The goal is to tell the user a story, a story about how taxi drivers in NYC can use information
            from the dataset as a leverage e.g. to earn more money. We want to show the user visualisation
            based on big data, which can e.g. be used to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                decide when during the day it is best to drive based on where the taxi driver is located
                (or where the taxi driver lives)
              </li>
              <li>
                decide where is the best pickup places for the taxi driver to maximize the length of the
                trip and therefore earn more money
              </li>
              <li>
                decide which pickup places are better than others based on if it is a weekend or not
              </li>
              <li>
                etc.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Therefore the goal is to have the story informative as well as to have the users, experience that they have learnt
            something useful and can use the visualisation to take valuable actions if they are or intent to be NYC taxi
            drivers.

          <!-- SECTION: 2 -->
          <h2>2. Basic stats. Let’s understand the dataset better</h2>

          <b>Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing</b>
          <p>
            The dataset for all the yellow trips 2017, is around 10GB. For this big dataset, it
            doesn't work to have the data locally on a web server, so it has to be preprocessed
            and cleaned.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, the 10GB data was downloaded on our local computers. Then all the data was uploaded to
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Storage</a> within
            the Google Cloud Platform. When we had all the data in the Google Cloud we used
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/" target="_blank">Google BigQuery</a> to do the
            data cleaning and preprocessing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, different database tables for the trips data were merged, as the data has to be
            downloaded per month. Next unnecessary features were removed. Thereafter outliers were detected
            and necessary actions were taken based on the nature of the outliers. As an example, it can be
            detected that there has been some input error on behalf of the taxi drivers when the record
            number of participants. That can be seen as few datapoints (trips) have 6, 7, 8 or 9
            number of participants even the yellow taxi (yellow taxi van) can maximum take 5 participants.
            The datapoints that were clearly affacted by input errors, were therefore removed.

          </p>
          <p>
            To create visualisation on a webpage which has to be fast, it is critical to run some queries to
            only get the necessary data for the visualisation. After the story has been decided and the
            visualisation has been chosen, queries were runned to extract necessary data from the dataset.
            The extracted data was stored locally on the web server in several CSV (.csv) files. The following
            quires were used:

          <b>What went well?</b>
          <p>
            Overall the execution of our plan for this analaysis project went great.
            As in most cases when you work with real and massive amount of data the
            data cleaning and preprocessing takes some time, getting good understanding
            of the data, detect outliers and make it useable. Even it took quite of time
            and effort we didn't hit any major problems with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had to fine tune little bit how we wanted to structure our story and
            visualisation after getting feedback from Assignment 1. After that was done
            it went really well building the visualisation as we have had some good experience
            from all of the weekly exercise and because we had prepare the story structure
            really well.
