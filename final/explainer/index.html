          <h2>1. Motivation</h2>

          <b>What is your dataset?</b>
          <p>
            Taxi trips dataset for New York was used for the analysis. The dataset is from
            the website <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml" target="_blank">NYC.gov</a>.
            The dataset contains taxi trips from yellow and green taxis but only the data
            for the yellow taxis were used. The dataset contains data of over 10 years, 2009-2017
            but it was decided to analyse all the data from 2017. The dataset contains
            among other things: pickup / drop-off locations and timestamps, payment types,
            number of passengers and trip distance.
          </p>

          <b>Why did you choose this particular dataset?</b>
          <p>
            This dataset is really popular and has been used in many data analysis. The reason
            for that and a part of the reasons why we chose this dataset, is because it has a lot
            of data, both in terms of features and in terms of a number of rows. So with many features and
            detailed meta-data for the trips, it is possible to investigate and analyse many different aspects
            of the dataset. Therefore we picked this dataset even though many people have used it before.
            We tried to find a new angle which others might not have covered before.
          </p>

          <b>What was your goal for the end user’s experience?</b>
          <p>
            The goal is to tell the user a story, a story about how taxi drivers in NYC can use information
            from the dataset as a leverage e.g. to earn more money. We want to show the user visualisation
            based on big data, which can e.g. be used to:
            <ul>
              <li>
                decide when during the day it is best to drive based on where the taxi driver is located
                (or where the taxi driver lives)
              </li>
              <li>
                decide where is the best pickup places for the taxi driver to maximize the length of the
                trip and therefore earn more money
              </li>
              <li>
                decide which pickup places are better than others based on if it is a weekend or not
              </li>
              <li>
                etc.
              </li>
            </ul>

            Therefore the goal is to have the story informative as well as to have the users, experience that they have learnt
            something useful and can use the visualisation to take valuable actions if they are or intend to be NYC taxi
            drivers.

          </p>




          <!-- SECTION: 2 -->
          <h2>2. Basic stats. Let’s understand the dataset better</h2>

          <b>Write about your choices in data cleaning and preprocessing</b>
          <p>
            The dataset for all the yellow trips 2017, is around 10GB. For this big dataset, it
            doesn't work to have the data locally on a web server, so it has to be preprocessed
            and cleaned.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, the 10GB data was downloaded on our local computers. Then all the data was uploaded to
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/" target="_blank">Google Cloud Storage</a> within
            the Google Cloud Platform. When we had all the data in the Google Cloud we used
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/" target="_blank">Google BigQuery</a> to do the
            data cleaning and preprocessing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, different database tables for the trips data were merged, as the data has to be
            downloaded per month. Next unnecessary features were removed. Thereafter outliers were detected
            and necessary actions were taken based on the nature of the outliers. As an example, it can be
            detected that there has been some input error on behalf of the taxi drivers when they record the
            number of participants. That can be seen as few data points (trips) have 6, 7, 8 or 9
            number of participants even the yellow taxi (yellow taxi van) can maximum take 5 participants.
            Another example of input error is data points where the drop-off timestamps are after the pickup
            timestamps. This is though very few data points compared to the number of data points in the dataset.
            The data points that were clearly affected by input errors, were therefore removed.
          </p>
          <p>
            For few of the visualisation, some calculations had to be done. Trip duration was calculated based
            on the pickup and drop-off timestamps. Further, the hour of the day when a taxi driver pickups
            a passenger was obtained from the pickup timestamp.
          </p>
          <p>
            To create visualisations on a webpage which has to be fast, it is critical to run some queries to
            only get the necessary data for the visualisation. After the story has been decided and the
            visualisation has been chosen, queries were run to extract necessary data from the dataset.
            The extracted data was stored locally on the web server in several CSV (.csv) files. The following
            queries were used:
          </p>
          <code>
            <h4>Number of trips and hours:</h4>

            As mentioned before the data was around 10 GB, containing 93 millions rows. Each row represents
            a taxi trip in 2017 with a Yellow taxi in New York City. In total the dataset includes 17

          <h2>3. Genre. Which genre of data story did you use?</h2>
          <p class="todo">
            The genre chosen was Annotated Graph. Bæta við meiri texta hér afhverju.
            Segja kannski því það eigi best við þegar svona gögn eins og okkar eru visualizuð...?
          </p>
          <b>Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Visual Narrative (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</b>
          <p>
            The three categories under Visual Narrative are Visual Structuring, Highlighting and Transition Guidance.<br />
            For Visual Structuring we used a <b>Consistent Visual Platform</b> we maintain a consistent colour palette, using
            the various range of green colour. Also the same font is used throughout the page.<br />
            Another Visual Structuring tool used was <b>Timebar</b>. There are two graphs that have their x-axis in connection with time.
            The first one shows how many taxi trips there are for every pick up hour, from 0:00 to 23:00.
            The other graph shows the taxi trip duration measured in minutes. <br />
            <br />
            From the Highlighting category we used the <b>Feature Distinction</b> tool. On our map, the taxi zones change in colours indicating
            how many taxi trip with a certain amount of passenger begin in each zone. E.g., the taxi zones are coloured
            in more darker green indicating more taxi trips began in that zone.<br />
            <br />
            From the Transition Guidance category the <b>Animated Transitions</b> tool was used.
            The user can click an animate brush which brushes through the bar chart of number of trips every pick up hour.
            While the brusher is going through the trip duration, the graph updates and displays the distribution of how long each
             taxi trip was in minutes.
          </p>

          <b>Which tools did you use from each of the 3 categories of Narrative Structure (Figure 7 in Segal and Heer). Why?</b>
          <p>
            The three categories under Narrative Structure are Ordering, Interactivity and Messaging. <br />
            For Ordering the <b>Linear</b> approuch was used when looking at the whole page. The page is ordered in
            that way the user is directed though it, he will start reading at the top of the page and explore
             the page downwards, discovering more graphs and explanatory texts. However, the user is in
             charge when he explores the map and the pickup hour and trip duration graphs, he can play around. For those
             graphs there the tool <b>User directed path</b> is used.<br />
             <br />
             The Interactivity category includes seven tools and our visualisation uses three of them. <br />
             <b>Hover Highlighting/Details;</b> On the map when the user hovers over a zone, then the tooltip displays
             details about how many trips with that many passengers began in that particular zone. <br />
             <b>Filtering/Selection/Search;</b> On the map the user can filter the trips after how many passengers
             where in each trip with the six check buttons to the right. The user can choose if he sees all taxi
             trips or e.g. just taxi trips with 5 and 6 passengers.<br />
             <b>Explicit Instruction;</b> Each graph and the map has exploratory text that tells the user what it is displaying.<br />
             <br />
             Messaging is about the ways a visualisation communicates observations to the user. <br />
             <b>Captions/Headlines</b> are used, as the page is divided into subsections, each with a descriptive headline. <br />
             <b>Annotations</b> are used as for each graph there is a note of explanation describing for the user
             the most important parts of the graph. <br />
             We used <b>Introductory Text</b> as it fitted well in the beginning of the page, introducing to the reader what
             the page is about and how it works. <br />
             At the end of the page theres a <b>Summary</b>, a brief text describing the main points of the visualisations.

          <b>What went well?</b>
          <p>
            Overall the execution of our plan for this analysis project went great.
            As in most cases when you work with real and massive amount of data the
            data cleaning and preprocessing takes some time, getting a good understanding
            of the data, detect outliers and make it useable. Even it took quite of time
            and effort we didn't hit any major problems with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            We had to fine tune little bit how we wanted to structure our story and
            visualisation after getting feedback from Assignment 1. After that was done
            it went really well building the visualisation as we have had some good experience
            from all of the weekly exercise and because we had prepared the story structure
            really well.
